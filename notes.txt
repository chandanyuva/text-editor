1. setup makefile and git

----Ch-2

2. using unistd.h library
	read() and STDIN_FILENO are from this lib

3. default term goes to "canonical" mode or "cooked" mode
	in this mode user input is only sent to program after the user presses enter [not usefull for texteditor]

4. we want "raw" mode
	Unfortunately, there is no simple switch you can flip to set the terminal to raw mode. Raw mode is achieved by turning off a great many flags in the terminal, which we will do gradually over the course of this chapter.

5. use Ctrl-D to tell read() "reached end of file"
	or use Ctrl-C to signal process to terminate immediately

6. adding 'q' to quit

7. turn off echoing
	The ECHO feature causes each key you type to be printed to the terminal, so you can see what you’re typing. This is useful in canonical mode, but really gets in the way when we are trying to carefully render a user interface in raw mode.
	Ctrl-c and type "reset" 

8. disable raw mode at exit
	We’ll save a copy of the termios struct in its original state, and use tcsetattr() to apply it to the terminal when the program exits.	

9. turn off canonical mode
	There is an ICANON flag that allows us to turn off canonical mode. This means we will finally be reading input byte-by-byte, instead of line-by-line.
	Now the program will quit as soon as you press q.
